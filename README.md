🗂️ Global State Management: Implemented using Redux Toolkit.

➕ Add Users: Add new users locally.

✏️ Edit Users: Edit existing user details.

❌ Delete Users: Remove users from the local Redux state.

🔍 View Details: View individual user information.

🔄 Local State Updates: Add, edit, and delete operations are handled locally without API requests.

🔥 Responsive & Styled UI: Clean, appealing card-based layout with smooth navigation.
