📋 User Management System


A fully functional User Management System built with React, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit. This project fetches user data from an external API and allows users to view, add, update, and delete user information locally within the app.


🚀 Features


🌐 Fetch Users: Initial user data fetched from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.

🗂️ Global State Management: Implemented using Redux Toolkit.

➕ Add Users: Add new users locally.

✏️ Edit Users: Edit existing user details.

❌ Delete Users: Remove users from the local Redux state.

🔍 View Details: View individual user information.

🔄 Local State Updates: Add, edit, and delete operations are handled locally without API requests.

🔥 Responsive & Styled UI: Clean, appealing card-based layout with smooth navigation.
